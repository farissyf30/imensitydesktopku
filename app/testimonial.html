                    <p>“Tictail therefore gets our highly commended 9 out of 10 rating and I believe that if you’re looking to flog a few of your creations online, then this is the best way to do it. The whole interface is so minimalistic, whilst at the time oozes that Scandinavian sense of design, and doesn’t overwhelm in the slightest with endless menus and customisation options.” - <b>Appstorm</b></p>
